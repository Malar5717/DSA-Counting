Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
Topic: DSA Counting / Frequency / Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
Status: âœ… Passed
Approach:
- Used Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
- Iterates once, adjusts vote count based on majority presence

Learnings:
- Clever use of votes lets you track the majority without extra space
- Works only if majority element is guaranteed (> n/2)
